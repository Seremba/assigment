# Back-end Assignment

Hi there, thanks for taking the time to show us your skills! 

By stepping up to this challenge, you give us a chance to see if and how you would fit in with the team technically.

We leave a lot of things in this challenge up to you and that is by design; if it's not specifically mentioned, feel free to pick and choose and inform us about those choices.

The platform team works mostly with **Java 11+**, some **Kotlin**, **Gradle** and **Spring Boot**, so because of that we have a preference the assignment is written using those tools, however if you ecosystem is different that's also fine.

Don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear!

Good luck!


## Pet Fish Co.
We'd like you to build an API that can keep track of the stock for Pet Fish Co., a ficticious pet fish store. The store boasts a number of different types of aquariums, each holding a certain amount of types of fish.


### Model
There's only two concepts involved in this aquatic world:
- Aquariums: they can vary in glass type, size (litres), and shape.
- Fish: they can vary in species, color, and number of fins. Think of a few but at least have a goldfish and a guppy.

There are also some rules:

- Goldfish can't go in the same aquarium as guppies.
- Fish with three fins or more don't go in aquariums of 75 litres or less.


### API endpoints
Now, Pet Fish Co. wants to have an application to keep track of all of its aquariums and their fish by having access to two endpoints:
1. one to create or update a fish, and
1. one to retrieve all fish for a given aquarium.


## Bonus
If you want to go out of your way and flex those dev skills, we like you to take into account that Pet Fish Co. is considering opening up a store across the pond in the US. That means theyâ€™ll have to be able to convert their aquarium size from litres to gallons.


## What do we expect from you
- Code that is fully working (bugs are perfectly fine, but your solution be functional and not just theoretical).
- A **Docker Compose** file that lets us run a test environment for your solution.
- A written `README.md` with instructions on how to run your test environment, as well as an explanation on how/why did you design things the way you did.


## What are we evaluating
You have all the freedom in the world to solve the challenge as you see fit. 
**We'll not judge you on the choice of framework, serialization library, etc** but we will be on the lookout for a few things:
- Your **approach to problem solving in general**, as well as your attention to the guidelines and specifications.
- Object-oriented design practices, specifically **how clean and organized is your code** and how flexible/mature your design looks like.
- **Clarity in the decisions and tradeoffs** you've made, and how deliberate they feel.
- How do you approach **testing and the quality of the tests**.
- Your approach towards **best practices, coding standards and use of versioning**.
- **What kind of dependencies you bring into the project**, and how do you justify their use.


## Time constraints
This assignment has been designed to fit roughly **3 to 4 hours of work**, and our evaluation takes that into consideration when looking into how thorough you are and the productivity shortcuts you've taken. Part of our evaluation is also to **understand how you manage to plan and execute your work** within the allotted time, so ideally **you should not spend longer than the given time**.

That being said, we understand that sometimes personal constraints can prevent you from giving the adequate focus, so we ask that you **keep us updated if you need more time** to work on your assignment.


## How to deliver the project
You will be given access to this private repository. **As soon as you start working, you should create a commit** replacing this README.md with a new file, containing your name and the date and time you started working.

Once you're finished with the work, you're to **tag the final commit with `v1.0.0`, and let our recruitment team know**.


## What if I have questions?
You're welcome to ask questions and clarify requirements with us!
For that, you can use the **Issues** tab on GitHub to create a new issue. You don't have to tag anyone. We'll try to respond to your issue within *1 working day*!


Good luck! :) 
We are looking forward to seeing your results!
